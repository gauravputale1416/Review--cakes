## 🚀 Introduction
This project is a beginner-friendly React application. It allows users to select a cake from a gallery and preview it in a larger view. A **zoom slider** is also added to enhance the user experience by letting them zoom in and out of the cake image.  

It helped me understand:
- Component structure in React  
- State management using hooks  
- Handling user events (click, input range)  
- Styling and layout in React
